# **Echo Messages**

## **echo** is a simple built-in shell command that prints out the text you give it to the terminal output screen.


# **Experiments**

### **1.** **echo** command does what its name says. It just echoes the text you give it. In other words, it simply prints out the text you give into your terminal screen. 

### **2.** To execute the **echo** command, type `echo`, leave a space. Then type the text you want to echo inside single quotes or double quotes. For example, `echo "hello"` or `echo 'hello'`. You can also simply type the text without the quotes. For example, `echo hello`. 

### **3.** Execute the following command to get a feel for this **echo** command: 

### `echo hello shell` 

### **4.** The `echo` command _**comes in handy**_ when we try to log information as a "bash script" code is being executed. For example, you can echo "installed" when a "bash script" had installed a certain software. Or you can echo "failed" or "error" when a bash script runs into trouble. The `echo` command thus makes it easy to know what's going on in your "bash script". Enter the below commands into a file named "echo.sh" and execute the "echo.sh" file by using `bash echo.sh` command: 

### echo "ps shows the currently running processes"

### `ps`

### echo "date command puts the current date and time"

### `date`

### echo "whoami puts the user currently logged in"

### `whoami`
