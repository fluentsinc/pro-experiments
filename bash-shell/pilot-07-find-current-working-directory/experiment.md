# **Find Current Working Directory**

## We always need to be aware of our current working directory(directory is an another term for a folder). The current working directory is the directory that you're currently working on. In other words, whatever commands you execute affects all the files inside the current working directory. For example, if you execute a command that removes all the files and subdirectories, the command affects only the files and subdirectories inside the current working directory. Hence, knowing what directory you've set as your current working directory is crucial as you might end up doing things to files and subdirectories from another directory that you are not supposed to be doing. 

## In Linux, the **current working directory**  when you login will always be the current user's home directory. 

# **Experiment**

### **1.** To display the current working directory, execute the command: 

### `pwd`

### Enter the output of the above command into "master.md"
