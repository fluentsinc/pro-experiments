# **Basics**

## **Bash shell** is a type of shell program found in some operating systems like Unix and Linux. Shell program is a computer program that takes commands that you would enter via a keyboard and returns an output based on the command you had issued(executed). Bash shell short for Bourne-again shell is a modern improvement over other shell programs that existed before it (Steve Bourne is the name of the British Mathematician and Computer Scientist that created the first bash shell program "sh"). Other shell programs like bash are sh, zsh, tcsh, ksh, csh etc. Bash shell was created by Brian Fox to extend the functionalities of the original sh program hence the name "bourne-again shell" _**aka**_ bash shell.   

## Shell programs like Bash have one function: they take commands from you and pass those commands to the operating system which either executes the commands or throws a error back to you. Shell programs are also referred to as just "shell" or "command-line interpreter"(since shell programs interpets lines of commands). 

## There are two kinds of user interface: Command-Line Interface(CLI) and Graphical User Interface(GUI). User interface is the way by which a user communicates with a computer.  Command-Line Interface(CLI) is a way of communicating with the computer by _**typing in**_ lines of commands. For example, shell programs like bash, sh, csh etc in Linux and Unix, powershell in Windows, command line tools such as aws-cli, azure-cli and git etc, compiler tools like **gcc** and **javac**, build tools like **make** and **gradle** are all examples of command-line interface(CLI) programs that work when a user types in text based commands. On the other hand, Graphical User Interface(GUI, pronounced gooey) is a way of communicating with the computer by clicking on graphical icons. For example, file explorer, task manager, task bar, start menu, desktop, browser etc are all examples of graphical user interface(GUI) programs since they all work when you click on the icons.

## In the early days when computers were the size of big rooms. Often, several programmers needed access to one big computer. To allow simultaneous use of a single computer, programmers used terminals. A Terminal is a device that lets you type in commands to the shell program running on the computer. Usually there were many terminals for a single computer. Each programmer would log in to a terminal, use up the computing power that they need and log out of the terminal when they're done. In modern times, we don't use hardware terminals anymore. Normal people mostly use GUI programs. Except for software developers, we use a software program called terminal emulator that _**emulates**_ the hardware terminals of the past. Terminal emulators take commands from you and passes them to the shell program. Some examples of terminal emulators are command prompt in Windows, Terminal in Linux and Terminal in macOS. A very important point here is that, a terminal emulator is a GUI program that sends the commands you type to a CLI shell program that in turn communicates with the operating system. For example, in Windows, the terminal emulator (command prompt) sends your commands to a shell program (powershell) which in turn talks to the Windows operating system. In Linux, the terminal emulator (terminal) sends your commands to a shell program (bash shell) which in turn talks to the Linux operating sytem. 


## **Why do we use the Bash Shell?**

## So why do software developers use a CLI like Bash Shell? Why not use a GUI like the ones you might have used in Windows or in Mac? The reason is, a CLI like Bash Shell makes difficult tasks possible to accomplish which would otherwise be time consuming and _**tedious**_ to do using a GUI. For example, let's imagine you have 100 folders that are named like, Folder1, Folder2,......Folder100. Let's say, there's a file named script.sh in each of these folders. And here's the difficult task: you need to go to a folder, say, Folder1, cut the script.sh file and create a new folder inside the same Folder1 folder and name it "Script1" and paste the script.sh inside the newly created folder. You need to do this for all hundred folders. Now imagine doing this simple yet boring task using a GUI. It might probably take several minutes. But with a CLI like Bash Shell, all you need to do is, run some commands and you can finish the same task in milliseconds.

# **Experiments**

### **1.** Open up Visual Studio Code. Press `ctrl + ~` to open up the integrated terminal. In Windows, 'Command Prompt' is the default terminal emulator. Anyway, since we want to learn bash shell on a Windows PC, we have installed `MINGW64`, a bash shell simulator for Windows. Typically, terminals show the sign `username@machinename`. So in the image you see below which I've blurred out a little bit, the username is "Achilles Troy" and machine name is "DESKTOP-" and some letters. Below the username and the machine name, you can see the dollar sign `$`. This symbol is called the shell prompt. When you see the shell prompt, it means the shell program is ready for you to type your commands. The bash shell is prompting you to type some commands. You can tell why in Windows they call the "terminal emulator" as command prompt. Because it's prompting you to type commands.

### **2.** Shell programs like Bash shell are usually written in C. Thus, shell programs are essentially C programs. Take a look at this repository to see the actual C program that makes up the bash shell: https://github.com/bminor/bash. Look for a file named "shell.c" in the repo. Enter the number of lines into "master.md". Shell usually contains other tiny C programs built into it. These tiny C programs are referred to as _**"built-in"**_ shell commands because they are _**built-in**_ into the shell program so you don't have to install them yourself. These programs are usually referred to as `coreutils` short for "core utilities". My interpretation of the naming of `coreutils` is that, just as a sculptor needs _**utilities**_ like a hammer and a chisel to _**carve out**_ a statue. A programmer needs these core utilities to create great programs. When you execute a built-in command on the bash shell, the bash shell is essentially executing the C program of the command. Let's try a few built-in commands: 

- ###  type `whoami` into your terminal and execute the command by pressing "enter". The `whoami` command outputs the user name of your computer. 

- ###  execute `date` to get the current date. 

- ###  execute `df` to see your disk's free space information. 

### You can actually look at the actual C program of these commands. Go to the `GNU/coreutils` repository on Github: https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils. Look for a folder named "src" short for "source code". Inside the "src" folder, you'll find C programs: "whoami.c", "date.c" and "df.c".  View these C programs and enter the number of lines each of them got into "master.md".
