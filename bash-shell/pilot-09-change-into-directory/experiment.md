# **Change Into Directory**

## Most often, you would need to change your current working directory to _**get around**_ your computer with bash shell. You would need to change your current working directory into different directories to work on different files. The `cd` command helps you change your current working directory to a different directory. A lot of the errors you could face as a software developer could be traced back to being on the wrong directory executing some commands on some files that don't exist.  

# **Experiments**

### **1.** To execute the `cd` command, type in `cd`, leave a space and enter the pathname of the directory that you want to change into. In other words, the syntax for `cd` is `cd pathname` where "pathname" should point to a directory that you would like to make your current working directory. Execute the following commands: 

### `cd /` 

### The above command changes the current working directory to the root directory as you might recall that the forward slash `/` refers to the root directory.

### `cd`

### When you enter `cd` without a pathname, the current working directory gets changed to the currently logged-in user's home directory.
