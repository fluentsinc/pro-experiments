# **Find Current Working Directory**

## We always need to be aware of our current working directory. Forgetting to do so is a major reason for many developer headaches and f-ups. Imagine thinking you're on the trash directory, thinking you're deleting all the files there. But in reality, you were on the master code base deleting everything that's important to the team.

# **Experiment**

1. ### To display the current working directory, try the command: `pwd`
