# **Command History**

## Sometimes when you use a terminal emulator, you would want to see your command history. In other words, you would want to see the list of all commands that you had just executed. 


# **Experiments**

### **1.** To see the command history one by one, you need to use your "down arrow" key and "up arrow" key to _**go back and forth**_ the list of all commands that you had executed.

### **2.** You could also use the `history` command. The `history` command prints out all the commands you had executed upto a default value. In most environments, the default value is 500. So it is possible that you could actually see the last 500 commands you had executed in a single session. Enter the following commands:

### `history`

### Copy the output of `history` into "master.md"
