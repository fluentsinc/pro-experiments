# **Bash Symbols**

## The term **bash symbols** is not a familiar term because I kinda _**made this one up**_. **Bash symbols** are what developers generally refer to as "special characters". Special characters(symbols like "@", "#", etc) are used by developers to mean something unique that often needs to be repeatedly referred to. For example, the forward slash "/" refers to the root directory we would refer quite often.    

# **Experiments**

### **1.** There are about twenty special characters in bash. We will take a good look at most of them in later pilots. For now, we are going to just look at the bash symbols that are often used. Execute the commands you see below: 

### `cd /` 

### The above command changes our current working directory to the root directory since for bash shell, the `/` symbol means the root directory. 

### `cd /home`

### The above command changes the directory into the "home" directory inside the "root" directory. We just got there to set ourselves up so that we can see what's inside the "home" directory. 

### `ls` 

### The above command lets you see what files and directories are inside the current working directory. We had changed into the "home" directory when we executed `cd /home`. So, since our current working directory is set to `/home`, when we executed `ls`, the command `ls` prints out the files and directories inside the "home" directory.
