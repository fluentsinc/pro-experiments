# **Move and rename files and directories**

# **Experiment**

1. ### The `mv` command does both file moving and file renaming. Create a playground "play" directory to explore this command. Create two directories "dest" destination directory and "src" source directory. Create a text file inside "src" and execute this command to move the directory into "dest": `mv src dest`. Unlike `cp` command, the "src" directory no longer exists because it's moved by the command. To move files, it's same as `cp`: `mv file1 dest`. To move multiple files: `mv file1 file2 dest`.

2. ### To rename a file, the pattern is: `mv old-name new-name`. To rename a file named "old.txt" to "new.txt. You would execute: `mv old.txt new.txt". Same pattern for directories. `mv old-directory new-directory`.
