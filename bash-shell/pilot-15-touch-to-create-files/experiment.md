# **Touch To Create Files**

## The `touch` command could be used to do a lot of things but developers most commonly use `touch` to create a new empty file.  

# **Experiments**

### **1.** To create a new file, type in `touch`, leave a space and enter the name of the file that you want to create with the extension. Execute the following commands:

### `touch new.txt` 

### The above command creates a file named "new" with the file extension ".txt". 

### `touch script.sh`

### The above command creates a file named "script" with the file extension ".sh"
