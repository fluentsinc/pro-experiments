# **Clear The Terminal Screen**

## Sometimes, the commands you type in and the output that they bring in might fill up the whole terminal screen. If you felt you want to get a clean screen, you can use the `clear` command. 

# **Experiments**

### **1.** The `clear` command simply clears the terminal screen. Execute the following commands:

### `cd`

### `cat .bashrc`

### The command `cd` makes sure you're on the home directory. 

### The command `cat .bashrc` prints out the bash commands inside the `.bashrc` file. We execute this command here only to simulate an instance when your terminal screen might get filled up with text. 

### `clear`

### The `clear` command clears the terminal screen off of the output generated by `cat .bashrc` command.
