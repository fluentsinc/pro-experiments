# **Remove files and directories**

# **Experiment**

1. ### The `rm` command lets you delete files and directories from the command-line. The general pattern to delete a file is `rm filename`. To delete multiples files, the pattern is `rm filename1 filename2`. 

2. ### To delete directories, you always need to specify the `-r` option so that it recursively deletes the directories and subdirectories. The pattern is `rm -r directoryname` will delete the directory with the specified name. 

3. ### Refer pdf-reader-page-no. 63,64 for a complete list of **options** available for `rm` command and some examples for `rm` command.
