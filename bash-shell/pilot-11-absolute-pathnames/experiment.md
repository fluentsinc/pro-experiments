# **Absolute Pathnames**

## **Absolute Pathnames** are pathnames that would always start with the root directory, follows the branches of subdirectories and end up finally at the desired directory or the file. 

# **Experiments**

### **1.** **Absolute pathnames** are pathnames that always start with the root directory. For example, the pathname `/usr/boot/script` is an absolute pathname whereas the pathname `boot/script` is not an absolute pathname since it doesn't start with the root directory. Execute the following commands: 

### `cd`

### `pwd` 

### Enter the output of the above command into "master.md"

### `cd /`

### `pwd`

### Enter the output of the above command into "master.md"

### `cd /usr/sbin`

### `pwd`

### Enter the output of the above command into "master.md". Also enter the "one level down" and "two levels down" directories into "master.md"
