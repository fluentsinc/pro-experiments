# **Man For Help**

## **man** is a built-in shell command that displays the manual of a bash shell program. 


# **Experiments**

### **1.** We use `man` to see information on how to use a bash shell program. To execute the `man` command, type in `man`, leave a space and enter the name of the bash shell program. For example, `man whoami` displays a manual page that tells you what `whoami` command does and how to use it. 

### **2.** When you execute the `man` command and see the manual page, you would see several section headings like Name, Synopsis, Description etc. Execute the following commands to _**get a feel for**_ the `man` command:

### `man whoami` 

### Look for the "Author" subheading and enter the name into "master.md" 

### `man ls`

### Look for the "Author" subheading and enter the name into "master.md"


### **3.** You need to use the down arrow to scroll down the manual page. Execute the following commands:

### `man man`

### As you can see, we can actually call `man on `man` itself since `man` is itself a C program that displays the manual pages. 

### Look for the "History" subheading way down below and enter the author name into "master.md".
