# **Basics**

## **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language designed to make instructions easy-to-read and easy-to-write. 

## Designed with **portability** in mind, it can be relatively easy to convert markdown to other markup languages like HTML and XHTML. 

## Markup languages are known for their easy-to-read, easy-to-write _**syntax**_. You would basically markup a text, view it using a markup parser(simply put, changes strings of symbols to look differently) to get the same text appear in a different way.  For example, take a look at this markup: `**bold**`, when you markup a text with two asterisks on each side, the **markdown** parser assumes that you want the text to look **bold**.

# **Experiment**

### **1.** Look at all the markdown markups in this cheatsheat created by Adam Pritchard: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

### **2.** Enter something into "master.md" using markdown markups. Play around with the markups.
