# **Prometheus Experiments**

## **Guidelines**

### 1. Make sure you've read `rookie-experiments/README.md` and `rookie-experiments/rookie-training-camp` thoroughly. 

### 2. Be active with the experiments. They are experiments after all. They are meant to be played with. Make mistakes. Quickly learn the mistakes. Correct the mistakes. Repeat. Do this faster. 

### 3. If the experiments asks you to enter something into **"master.md"** file, it means you need to follow the playcall - **master |adventurist|**.
